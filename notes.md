Colors
-------------
The Wahoo Bolt2 uses 64 color. When using Hex color only following values are used:
| Hex Value  | 
| ------------- |
| 00  |
| 55  |
| 99  |
| AA  |
| FF  |

On Cruiser this results in pretty screaming color, but on the reflective display they are quite nice.

Be aware that the lightest gray is `#AAAAAA`.
Make sure to create a suitable contrast!

Symbols
-------------
To adjust the size of symbols they can be scaled like this:

`<symbol src="icons/train_station.svg" symbol-percent="130"/>`


Railway presentation
-------------
Apart from the dashed lines there is the possibility of adding stipple strokes like this:

`<line cap="butt" fade="12" fix="true" stipple="15" stipple-stroke="#ffffff" stipple-width="0.7" stroke="#000000"  width="3" />`
